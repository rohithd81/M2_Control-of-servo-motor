There are several unique electrical motor applications in which the motor must rotate at a specific angle rather than constantly for an extended period of time. For these applications, specialised motors with unique arrangements that cause the motor to rotate at a specific angle for a particular electrical input are required (signal). Normally, this is a simple motor that is regulated for particular angular rotation using supplementary servomechanism (a typical closed loop feedback control system). A servo motor is a type of motor that is automatically driven up to a set limit for a given command using error-sensing feedback to adjust performance.
