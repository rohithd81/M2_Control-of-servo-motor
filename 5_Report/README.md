Introduction
Servos are controlled by sending an electrical pulse of variable width, or pulse width modulation (PWM), through the control wire. There is a minimum pulse, a maximum pulse, and a repetition rate. A servo motor can usually only turn 90° in either direction for a total of 180° movement.

Objective
Servo motors are utilized by items that are used every day. Home electronic devices like DVD and Blu-ray Disc players use servos to extract and retract disc trays. Automobiles also use servo motors. In modern cars, servo motors are used to control its speed.

WORKING PRINCIPLE
A servo motor is controlled by controlling its position using Pulse Width Modulation Technique. The width of the pulse applied to the motor is varied and send for a fixed amount of time. The pulse width determines the angular position of the servo motor.

Advantage
High output power relative to their size.
More constant torque at higher speed.
Closed-loop control.
Quiet operation.
Highly reliable.
High ratio of torque to inertia.
High acceleration.
Disvantage
Servos Motors requires tuning to stabilize the feedback loop.
Servo Motor will become unpredictable when something breaks. ...
