# Introduction
Servos are controlled by sending an electrical pulse of variable width, or pulse width modulation (PWM), through the control wire. There is a minimum pulse, a maximum pulse, and a repetition rate. A servo motor can usually only turn 90° in either direction for a total of 180° movement.
# Objective
Servo motors are utilized by items that are used every day. Home electronic devices like DVD and Blu-ray Disc players use servos to extract and retract disc trays. Automobiles also use servo motors. In modern cars, servo motors are used to control its speed.
# Components Required
* ATMEGA328
* SERVO MOTOR
* 5V POWER SUPPLY

# Description
# ATMEGA328
* Microchip's ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-pin AVR Microcontroller that uses RISC architecture and includes a 32KB flash-type programme memory.
* The Atmega328 microcontroller is found in the Arduino UNO, Arduino Pro Mini, and Arduino Nano boards.
* It can function at voltages ranging from 3.3 to 5.5 volts, but we usually choose 5 volts as a standard.
* Cost-effectiveness, low power consumption, programming lock for security, and true timer counter with independent oscillator are only a few of its outstanding qualities.
* It's most commonly found in Embedded Systems. Take a look at these Real-Life Embedded System Examples; we can design all of them with this Microcontroller.
# SERVO MOTOR
A servo system comprises of an actuator (muscle), a control device (brain), and a feedback element in its most basic form (the senses). While the muscle can be a variety of mechanisms in the automation sector, it is most frequently represented by a servo motor. The brain can be represented by a number of different parts, although it is most commonly a motion controller or servo drive. A current sensor and/or an encoder, resolver, or even a vision system deliver feedback information to the brain. When the control device instructs the actuator to move to a given point, the actuator begins to move, and the feedback device informs the controller of where the actuator is travelling and how quickly it is moving.
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
A servo motor is controlled by controlling its position using Pulse Width Modulation Technique. The width of the pulse applied to the motor is varied and send for a fixed amount of time. The pulse width determines the angular position of the servo motor.
# Advantage
